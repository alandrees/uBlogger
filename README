Very simple desktop client for WordPress.  Utilizes PyGTK, and a library called wordpresslib (https://code.google.com/p/wordpress-library/).

Modified the wordpresslib slightly to allow for sending tags as well.

Modifications to wordpress:
			Line 115: added self.tags = ''
			line 227: added a comma (to continue the list)
			line 228: added: 'mt_keywords' = post.tags
